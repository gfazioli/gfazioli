Hi there, my name is Giovambattista (John) Fazioli. I am an Italian Lead Developer. Positive and creative, Iâ€™m a natural problem-solver, passionate about bringing ideas to life.

I started developing in 1983! Amazing years! In the beginning,  I used to work in design and graphic applications. I worked on Commodore Vic-20, Commodore 64, Commodore 128, Amiga 1000, 500 and 2000. I loved to develop in Assembly; Z-80, 6510, 6520, 8086, 80Ã—86 and Motorola series (680xx).

Next, I was engaged by a telecommunication company as a program developer. I worked in C/C++ (Digital Unix and Sun OS), PHP, Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft Visual C++ and Macromedia Actionscript. I worked for them for about 7 years and, after that, I become a freelance and decided to work for myself!

So I started my own company and startups, where my position was CTO.

I am currently in charge as Lead Developer for [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com). I enjoy working with include ReactJS, TypeScript and NextJS.
